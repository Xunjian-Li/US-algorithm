# US-algorithm
In this paper, we propose the upper-crossing/solution (US) algorithm, a non-bracketing root-finding method for solving non-linear equations g(\theta) = 0. The algorithm involves two steps per iteration: the U-step, which finds an upper-crossing function U(\theta), and the S-step, solving U(\theta) = 0 to update \theta. It offers two main advantages: strong stability and independence from initial values, unlike Newtonâ€™s method. Several methods for constructing U-functions and applications in statistics are discussed, along with convergence analysis and acceleration techniques.
